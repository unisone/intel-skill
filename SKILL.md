## Step 1: Parse Input

Parse the user's input: `/intel [MODE] [TOPIC]`

**MODES:**
| Mode | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `gaps` | Find market gaps and unmet needs |
| `competitors` | Map competitive landscape |
| `sentiment` | Quantify love/hate ratio |
| `pricing` | Research pricing strategies |
| `trends` | Analyze direction and velocity |
| `pain` | Find top frustrations |
| `full` | Complete report (all modes) |

**If no mode specified**, default to `full`.

**Store:**
- `MODE = [extracted mode]`
- `TOPIC = [extracted topic]`

---

## Step 2: Execute Searches

Run **5-8 searches per mode**. Keep queries SIMPLE — complex boolean often fails.

### Search Templates by Mode

**GAPS MODE** — Find unmet needs:
```
Search 1: {TOPIC} "I wish" site:reddit.com
Search 2: {TOPIC} frustrating OR annoying site:reddit.com  
Search 3: {TOPIC} "would pay for" site:reddit.com
Search 4: {TOPIC} feature request site:news.ycombinator.com
Search 5: {TOPIC} problems complaints 2025 2026
Search 6: {TOPIC} missing features gaps
```

**COMPETITORS MODE** — Map landscape:
```
Search 1: {TOPIC} vs alternative site:reddit.com
Search 2: {TOPIC} competitors comparison 2026
Search 3: best {TOPIC} alternatives
Search 4: {TOPIC} review site:producthunt.com
Search 5: {TOPIC} pricing plans comparison
Search 6: "switched from" {TOPIC} to site:reddit.com
```

**SENTIMENT MODE** — Quantify opinions:
```

Search 2: {TOPIC} hate OR terrible site:reddit.com
Search 3: {TOPIC} honest review 2025 2026
Search 4: {TOPIC} worth it site:reddit.com
Search 5: {TOPIC} overrated OR underrated
Search 6: {TOPIC} complaints site:twitter.com
```

**PRICING MODE** — Research pricing:
```

Search 3: {TOPIC} expensive OR cheap site:reddit.com
Search 4: {TOPIC} pricing comparison
Search 5: {TOPIC} "how much does" cost

```

Search 3: {TOPIC} future prediction 2026
Search 4: {TOPIC} news announcement 2026
Search 5: {TOPIC} hype OR bubble

```

**PAIN MODE** — Find frustrations:
```
Search 1: {TOPIC} frustrating painful site:reddit.com
Search 2: {TOPIC} biggest problem site:reddit.com
Search 3: {TOPIC} workaround hack site:reddit.com
Search 4: {TOPIC} rant vent site:reddit.com
Search 5: {TOPIC} broken buggy unreliable
Search 6: {TOPIC} complaints issues 2026
```

**FULL MODE** — Run 2-3 searches from EACH mode above.

---

## Step 3: Extract & Synthesize

For each result, extract:
- **Source URL** (required)
- **Platform** (Reddit, HN, Twitter, blog)
- **Key quote** (most relevant 1-2 sentences)
- **Engagement hint** (if URL contains /comments/ or shows votes in snippet)

### Weighting Rules
1. **Reddit/HN** → Highest weight (real discussions)
2. **Twitter/X** → High (real-time sentiment)
3. **Product Hunt** → Medium (launch feedback)
4. **Blogs** → Medium (detailed but may be biased)
5. **Company sites** → Lowest (facts only, not opinions)

### Pattern Detection
- What appears in **3+ sources**? → Strong signal
- What has **engagement hints** (comments, upvotes mentioned)? → Validated
- **Contradictions** between sources? → Note them
- **Data gaps**? → Acknowledge low confidence

## Error Handling

**If search returns few/no results:**
```markdown
## /intel {MODE}: {TOPIC}

### Limited Data Available

Only {n} relevant sources found. This could mean:
- Niche/emerging topic with sparse coverage
- Try broader search terms
- Topic may not have significant online discussion

**What I found:**
[List whatever was found]

**Suggestions:**
- Try: /intel {MODE} [broader term]
- Try: /intel {MODE} [related term]
```

**If topic is ambiguous:**
Ask clarifying question before searching:
```
The topic "{TOPIC}" could mean several things:
1. [Interpretation 1]
2. [Interpretation 2]

Which should I research?
```

## Quality Checklist

Before outputting, verify:
- [ ] Every finding has a source URL
- [ ] Numbers are specific ("12 mentions" not "many")
- [ ] Direct quotes are actual quotes from sources
- [ ] Confidence level matches data quality
- [ ] Format matches templates exactly
- [ ] Actionable — founder can decide something

---

## Context Memory

After research, remember:
- `MODE`: {mode}
- `TOPIC`: {topic}  
- `KEY_FINDINGS`: Top 3-5 insights
- `SOURCES`: URLs you found

**You are now an expert on this topic.**

For follow-ups:
- Answer from your research (don't re-search)
- Cite the sources you found
- Offer to dive deeper on any finding

Only new research if user asks about DIFFERENT topic.

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Don't hallucinate sources** — If you didn't find it, don't cite it
❌ **Don't use vague numbers** — "Several" "Many" "Some" → Use actual counts
❌ **Don't skip the format** — Follow templates exactly
❌ **Don't over-promise** — Low data = say "low confidence"
❌ **Don't re-search on follow-ups** — Use what you already found

---

## Reference Examples

See the `examples/` folder for complete output examples:
- `examples/gaps-example.md` — AI video editing gaps analysis
- `examples/competitors-example.md` — Notion competitive landscape  
- `examples/sentiment-example.md` — Claude Code sentiment analysis

Use these as templates for consistent output formatting.
