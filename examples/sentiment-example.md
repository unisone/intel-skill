## /intel sentiment: Claude Code

### TL;DR
Claude Code has **strong positive sentiment (7.5/10)** for coding capability but significant frustration around **usage limits and unpredictable consumption**. Users love the quality of output; they hate not knowing when they'll hit the wall. Recent sentiment is declining due to rate limit changes in January 2026.

### Key Findings

**1. Coding Quality Is Highly Praised**
Users consistently rate Claude Code as the best coding assistant, especially for complex multi-file projects and understanding context.
> "Claude Code is ALL you need to even build very complex applications as a non-coder." — [Source: r/ChatGPTCoding]

**2. Usage Limits Are the #1 Complaint**
Even $200/month Max plan users hit limits quickly. The unpredictability is more frustrating than the limits themselves.
> "Single message consuming 3% usage with Thinking mode. Nothing about my workflow changed. It feels extremely aggressive." — [Source: r/ClaudeCode]

**3. Rate Limit Changes Hurt Trust**
January 2026 changes (post-holiday bonus removal) created backlash. Users feel limits changed without transparency.
> "This change happened without any clear explanation or transparency. It feels like users are being quietly pushed to use the product less while paying the same amount." — [Source: r/ClaudeCode]

**4. Plan Mode Gets Love**
Users report 20-30% better results using Plan Mode even for small tasks. It's become a recommended best practice.
> "Use Plan Mode by default - I seem to get 20-30% better results when using it for anything even for small tasks." — [Source: r/ClaudeAI]
