# Example: /intel competitors Notion

## /intel competitors: Notion

### TL;DR
Notion dominates the "all-in-one workspace" category but faces fragmentation pressure — power users are splitting workflows across specialized tools (Obsidian for PKM, Linear for projects, Coda for databases). The main vulnerability is **offline/local-first** and **privacy concerns** where competitors like Obsidian and Anytype are winning converts.

### Key Findings

**1. Obsidian Is Winning the PKM Crowd**
Users who prioritize local-first, markdown ownership, and privacy are migrating to Obsidian. The plugin ecosystem is a major draw.
> "I moved all my notes to Obsidian. Own my data, works offline, plugins for everything. Notion felt like renting my brain." — [Source: r/PKMS]

**2. Linear Eating Project Management Use Case**
Teams that used Notion for project tracking are moving to Linear for its speed and opinionated workflow. Notion's flexibility becomes a liability.
> "Notion is great for docs but terrible for fast project management. Linear just works." — [Source: r/SaaS]

**3. Anytype Emerging for Privacy-Conscious**
Self-hosted, encrypted, open-source — Anytype is capturing users worried about Notion's data practices.
> "I'm now on the Anytype camp, super powers! I actively recommend against using Notion to my friends." — [Source: r/PKMS]

**4. Notion Still Wins for Team Wikis**
Despite competition, Notion remains the default for company wikis and documentation. The sharing/collaboration UX is unmatched.
> "For internal docs and wikis, nothing beats Notion. We tried Confluence, Slite, GitBook — came back to Notion." — [Source: r/startups]

### Data Summary

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Sources analyzed | 22 | Reddit: 16, HN: 4, Other: 2 |
| Strong signals | 4 | Obsidian, Linear, Anytype, Coda |
| Confidence | HIGH | Consistent across sources |

### Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Positioning | Mentioned | Sentiment |
|------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| Obsidian | Local-first PKM | 14x | 👍 Strong positive |
| Linear | Fast project management | 8x | 👍 Positive |
| Anytype | Privacy-first, self-hosted | 6x | 👍 Positive |
| Coda | Database-heavy workflows | 5x | 😐 Mixed |
| Craft | Apple-native notes | 4x | 😐 Mixed |
| Confluence | Enterprise wikis | 4x | 👎 Negative |

### Positioning Gap
**Local-first + Team Collaboration** — Obsidian is local but weak on real-time collab. Notion is collab-first but cloud-only. A tool that does both could capture users who want "Obsidian for teams."

### Limitations
- Sentiment is directional, not quantified with exact percentages
- Enterprise segment underrepresented in Reddit discussions
