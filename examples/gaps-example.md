## /intel gaps: AI video editing

### TL;DR
The biggest unmet need is **brand consistency across clips** — creators want AI that remembers their style, fonts, and colors across multiple videos. Current tools treat each video as isolated, forcing manual reapplication of brand settings every time.

### Key Findings

**1. Brand Memory is Broken**
Creators spend more time reapplying brand settings than actually editing. AI video tools don't remember style preferences between sessions or projects.

**2. Scene Transitions Are Jarring**
AI generates good individual clips but connecting them smoothly requires extensive manual work. Users want "transition intelligence" that understands narrative flow.
> "The AI makes great 5-second clips but stitching them together is a nightmare. Zero understanding of pacing." — [Source: r/editors]

**3. Audio-Visual Sync Still Manual**
Beat matching, lip sync, and sound design remain poorly automated despite being commonly requested features.
> "Auto-beat sync is a joke. I still do it frame by frame." — [Source: ProductHunt comments]

**4. No Good "Restore Old Footage" Tool**
Upscaling exists but comprehensive restoration (stabilization + color + noise + sharpening) in one tool is missing. Users cobble together 4-5 apps.
> "Why do I need Topaz for upscaling, DaVinci for color, and AE for stabilization? Someone build an all-in-one." — [Source: r/VideoEditing]

### Data Summary

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Sources analyzed | 18 | Reddit: 12, HN: 3, Other: 3 |
| Strong signals | 4 | Appeared in 3+ sources |
| Confidence | HIGH | Multiple corroborating sources |

### Market Opportunities

| Rank | Gap | Signal Strength | Evidence |
|------|-----|-----------------|----------|
| 1 | Brand consistency/memory | 8 mentions | "Brand settings don't persist" |
| 2 | Smart transitions | 6 mentions | "Stitching clips is manual" |
| 3 | Audio-visual sync | 5 mentions | "Beat sync doesn't work" |
| 4 | All-in-one restoration | 4 mentions | "Need 5 apps for one task" |

### Recommended Action
Build a "brand memory" layer that sits on top of existing AI video tools. This has the highest signal strength, clear willingness to pay, and could be a lightweight add-on rather than a full video editor.

### Limitations
- Engagement metrics (upvotes) estimated from thread activity
- Some sources from late 2025, market may have evolved
